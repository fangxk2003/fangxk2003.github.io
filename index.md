  <p>
    During the past years, I have completed the basic courses in the major of biomedical engineering with excellence and taken part in a few research projects.

## Research Experience

- **Region-specific Anomaly Detection in fMRI for Brain Disease Diagnosis**
  - *May 2024 - May 2025, Chun-Tsung Program(CTP), SJTU*
  - Advisor: Prof. Lichi Zhang, School of Biomedical Engineering, SJTU
  - I collected and preprocessed rs-fMRI and T1w-MRI data from 1,588 UK Biobank subjects using standard pipelines and extracted BOLD signals via AAL-424 atlas. I took part in designing and evaluating RSAD, a novel anomaly detection model, against multiple baselines (AE, BrainLM, Anomaly Transformer). I also conducted ablation studies on key RSAD modules (AML, ARoM, Sdis), confirming the critical role of region-specific discrepancy scoring in boosting detection performance across Alzheimer’s, depression, and Parkinson’s disease tasks.
  - Key words: Anomaly detection, Self-supervised learning, rs-fMRI, Brain disease diagnosis



- **AI-based Deep Learning for Automatic Whole-Brain Vessel Segmentation and Aging Correlation Analysis in Elderly Subjects**
  - *Jan 2025 - May 2025, SJTU*
  - Advisor: Prof. Yao Li, School of Biomedical Engineering, SJTU
  - We applied the CereVessSeg model for high-precision brain vessel segmentation on ToF-MRA images from healthy subjects in the CHUV and MIDAS datasets; constructed population-level vascular atlases as structural references; designed and implemented a complete evaluation pipeline with multi-metric performance assessment.
  - Key words: ToF-MRA, Brain vessel segmentation, Vascular atlas



- **The Impact of Cognitive-Motor Expertise on Brain Dynamics**

  - *March 2023 – September 2023, Undergraduate Research Project(PRP), SJTU*

  - Advisor: Prof. Yue Zhang, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, SJTU

  - I processed and interpreted EEG signals using MATLAB and EEGLAB, including ERP (Event-Related Potential) analysis, PCA (Principal Component Analysis), and time-frequency analysis. Then I investigated theta and alpha oscillations to explore neural dynamics during action prediction tasks. Finally We identified significant differences in ERP activity and theta/alpha oscillations between experts and novices, particularly under inconsistent action conditions.

  - Key words: EEG, ERP, Action prediction



My GPA is 3.78/4.0, 88.5/100

My research interest is now on solving clinical problems from medical images like CT and MRI. 

I also find my interest in fields like MRI sequence designing and have finished the graduate-level MRI course.

I was trained for the Informatics Olympiad before, so I am familiar with data structures, optimization algorithm, graph theory and basic number theory. I am fluent in programming with C++, python, and MATLAB too.

I am learning German and have achieved B1 level.
