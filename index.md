  <p>
    I am a third-year undergraduate student in the School of Biomedical Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
  </p>
  <p>
    During the past years, I have completed the basic courses in the major of biomedical engineering with excellence and taken part in a few research projects.

My research interest is now on diagnosis and screening of diseases from medical images like CT and MRI using machine learning method. I'm currently engaged in research as an undergraduate in [the Medical Image Computing Lab](https://mic.sjtu.edu.cn/).

I also find my interest in fields like MRI sequence designing (DTI, CMR, etc.) and have finished the graduate-level MRI course.

I spend plenty of time training for the Informatics Olympiad before, so I am familiar with data structures, optimization algorithm, graph theory and number theory (from engineering perspective). I am fluent in programming with C++, python, and MATLAB too.

I can also do a bit Java and C#.

I am learning German in my spare time and have achieved B1 level.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, please contact me any time :)

My email address is fangxk2003@gmail.com



## Research Experience

- **Undergraduate Research Project (PRP)**

  *March 2023 – September 2023, SJTU*

  - **Project Title**: The Impact of Cognitive-Motor Expertise on Brain Dynamics
  - **Advisor**: Prof. Yue Zhang, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology
  - **Key Responsibilities**
    - Processed and interpreted EEG signals using MATLAB and EEGLAB, including ERP (Event-Related Potential) analysis, PCA (Principal Component Analysis), and time-frequency analysis.
    - Investigated theta and alpha oscillations to explore neural dynamics during action prediction tasks.
  - **Key Findings**:
    - Identified significant differences in ERP activity and theta/alpha oscillations between experts and novices, particularly under inconsistent action conditions.
    - Demonstrated that motor expertise enhances neural efficiency and adaptability in complex cognitive-motor tasks.
  - **Skills Developed**:
    - EEG data acquisition and preprocessing (filtering, segmentation, ICA).
    - Advanced signal processing techniques (PCA, time-frequency analysis).
    - Statistical analysis and interpretation of neural data.
    - Scientific writing and presentation of research findings.
