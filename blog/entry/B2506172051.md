## Grundy Number and Mex

[Combinatorial Game Theory | Set 3 (Grundy Numbers/Numbers and Mex)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/combinatorial-game-theory-set-3-grundy-numbers-numbers-and-mex/)

This is a intuitive blog into Grundy number.

### Grundy Number

[Grundy Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimber) is a number that defines a state of a game. We can define any [impartial game](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-combinatorial-game-theory/) (example : nim game) in terms of Grundy Number.



### Minimum Excludant (Mex)

‘Minimum excludant’ a.k.a ‘Mex’ of a set of numbers is the smallest non-negative number not present in the set.

G(S) = Mex{G(All Possible State that lead to S)}

It's useful technique in Nim extended games.

## Alpha-Beta Pruning

Technically this is not a "Method" in CGT.

[Alpha-Beta Pruning Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha–beta_pruning)

 It stops evaluating a move when at least one possibility has been found that proves the move to be worse than a previously examined move. Such moves need not be evaluated further. 

When applied to a standard minimax tree, it returns the same move as minimax would, but prunes away branches that cannot possibly influence the final decision.

It's used in [PE-P505](https://projecteuler.net/problem=505)
